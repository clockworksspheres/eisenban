 This fork of the Kanbaru project can be found here:

[Kanbaru License](./src/kanbaru/LICENSE)

A Kanban-style, list-making project management application that helps you organize and visualize your tasks efficiently and effectively.

Eisenban will be a re-branded version of Kanbaru with some different/enhanced features, as the Kanbaru project is frozen and no longer developed.
