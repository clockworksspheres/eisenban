# Signing PowerShell Script Self

To self-sign a PowerShell script (.ps1) without specifying a DNS name, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Self-Signed Certificate:

Use the New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet to create a self-signed certificate. Since you don't need to specify a DNS name, you can omit the -DnsName parameter.

Example command:

''' powershell
$selfsigncert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "CN=PowerShell Code Signing" -KeyAlgorithm RSA -KeyLength 2048 -Type CodeSigningCert -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My
'''

2. Move the Certificate to Trusted Root:

Move the newly created self-signed certificate to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.

Example command:

''' powershell
Move-Item "Cert:\LocalMachine\My\$($selfsigncert.Thumbprint)" Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
'''

3. Sign the PowerShell Script:

Obtain a reference to the code signing certificate in the Trusted Root store.

Example command:

''' powershell
$selfsignrootcert = "Cert:\LocalMachine\Root\$($selfsigncert.Thumbprint)"
'''

Sign the PowerShell script using the Set-AuthenticodeSignature cmdlet.

Example command:

''' powershell
Set-AuthenticodeSignature C:\path\to\your\script.ps1 $selfsignrootcert
'''

By following these steps, you can self-sign a PowerShell script without specifying a DNS name, ensuring the script is signed and trusted within your local environment. This method is suitable for internal use but may not be trusted in public-facing environments due to the lack of third-party verification. If you need to distribute scripts externally, consider obtaining a code-signing certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA).
