Not likely practical...

# is there any indication inside a python threading.Thread that a thread is complete?

 Python Thread Completion Indication

In Python, a threading.Thread object does not inherently provide an indication that a thread is complete. However, you can check if a thread is still running using the is_alive() method. For example:

``` python
if my_thread.is_alive():
    print("Thread is still running")
else:
    print("Thread has completed")
```
 

This method returns True if the thread is still running and False if it has finished execution or was never started.

Additionally, you can use the join() method to wait for the thread to complete before continuing with the rest of your program. This method will block the calling thread until the thread whose join() method is called has finished execution.

For instance:

``` python
my_thread.start()
my_thread.join()  # Waits for the thread to complete
print("Thread has completed")
```

If you need to perform actions after the thread has completed, you can use the join() method to ensure that your program waits for the thread to finish before proceeding.

It's worth noting that if a thread is set as a daemon thread (using daemon=True), it will automatically terminate when the main program ends, and you do not need to explicitly manage its completion.



If you want to get line-by-line output from a thread in Python, you can use standard output (print statements) or a shared data structure like a queue to capture the output. Here are two common approaches:
1. Using Print Statements

You can simply use print statements within the thread to output line-by-line data. This is straightforward but may not be suitable for more complex or concurrent scenarios.

``` python
import threading
import time

def my_thread_function():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Line {i}")
        time.sleep(1)

# Create and start the thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=my_thread_function)
thread.start()

# Wait for the thread to complete
thread.join()
``` 

2. Using a Queue

A more robust approach is to use a queue.Queue to capture the output from the thread and then process it in the main thread. This ensures that the output is captured and can be handled in a controlled manner.

``` python
import threading
import time
import queue

def my_thread_function(output_queue):
    for i in range(5):
        output_queue.put(f"Line {i}")
        time.sleep(1)

# Create a queue to hold the output
output_queue = queue.Queue()

# Create and start the thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=my_thread_function, args=(output_queue,))
thread.start()

# Process the queue in the main thread
while thread.is_alive() or not output_queue.empty():
    try:
        line = output_queue.get(timeout=0.1)
        print(line)
    except queue.Empty:
        continue

# Wait for the thread to complete
thread.join()
``` 

Explanation:

    Using Print Statements:

        Simple and easy to implement.

        Output is directly printed to the console.

        Not suitable for complex or concurrent scenarios where you need to capture and process the output in a controlled manner.

    Using a Queue:

        More robust and suitable for complex scenarios.

        Captures the output in a queue, allowing you to process it in the main thread.

        Ensures that the output is handled in a controlled and thread-safe manner.

Choose the approach that best fits your needs based on the complexity and requirements of your application.

# NOTES: 

 * possibly catching on RE expressions and signaling on those, 

 * or signaling on line by line -

 * or using queue's and signaling on stuff coming out of queue's... 

 * better to come out of the threading class itself I think...

 * slot can thread.join() for faster processing??

 * also can send signals to other classes with or without data or pointers to data that processing is complete...

## is there a way to make a class that uses threading.thread to run a command?

Certainly! You can create a class that uses `threading.Thread` to run a command and captures its output line by line. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

``` python
import threading
import queue
import subprocess
import time

class CommandThread(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, command, output_queue):
        super().__init__()
        self.command = command
        self.output_queue = output_queue

    def run(self):
        # Use subprocess.Popen to start the command
        process = subprocess.Popen(self.command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True, shell=True)
        
        # Read the output line by line
        for line in process.stdout:
            self.output_queue.put(line.strip())

        # Read the error output line by line
        for line in process.stderr:
            self.output_queue.put(f"Error: {line.strip()}")

        # Wait for the process to complete and get the return code
        process.wait()
        self.output_queue.put(f"Command returned with code: {process.returncode}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a queue to hold the output
    output_queue = queue.Queue()

    # Create and start the thread
    command = "ls -l"  # Replace with your command
    thread = CommandThread(command, output_queue)
    thread.start()

    # Read and print the output line by line
    while thread.is_alive() or not output_queue.empty():
        try:
            line = output_queue.get(timeout=0.1)
            print(line)
        except queue.Empty:
            continue

    # Wait for the thread to complete
    thread.join()
    print("Thread has completed")
```

# Explanation:

1. **CommandThread Class**:
    
    - ****init** method**: Initializes the thread with the command to run and the output queue.
        
    - **run method**: This method is overridden from `threading.Thread` and is called when the thread starts. It runs the command using `subprocess.Popen`, captures the output and error line by line, and puts each line into the output queue. Finally, it waits for the process to complete and puts the return code into the queue.
        
2. **Example Usage**:
    
    - **output_queue**: A `queue.Queue` object is created to hold the output from the thread.
        
    - **thread**: An instance of `CommandThread` is created with the command and output queue.
        
    - **thread.start()**: The thread is started.
        
    - **Reading from the queue**: The main thread enters a loop where it checks if the thread is still alive or if there are any items left in the queue. It uses `queue.get(timeout=0.1)` to try to get an item from the queue with a timeout to avoid blocking indefinitely.
        
    - **thread.join()**: The main thread waits for the worker thread to complete.
        

This approach ensures that the command is run in a separate thread, and its output is captured and printed line by line in the main thread. The use of a queue ensures that the communication between threads is thread-safe.
