PySide6 Class ABC QWidget 

It sounds like you're diving into PySide6 and looking to create an abstract base class (ABC) for a custom widget. Let's put this into action!
First, you'll need to import the necessary modules from PySide6. Then, you can create a base class using ABC from the abc module along with QWidget. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```Python
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QWidget
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MyWidgetBase(ABC, QWidget):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.setup_ui()

    @abstractmethod
    def setup_ui(self):
        pass  # This method will be implemented by subclasses
```


In this example, MyWidgetBase is an abstract base class that inherits from both ABC and QWidget. It has an abstract method setup_ui that must be implemented by any subclass.

Here's how you might subclass MyWidgetBase:

```Python
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QLabel, QVBoxLayout

class MyCustomWidget(MyWidgetBase):
    def setup_ui(self):
        layout = QVBoxLayout(self)
        label = QLabel("Hello, PySide6!", self)
        layout.addWidget(label)
        self.setLayout(layout)
```


In this subclass, setup_ui is implemented to create a simple layout with a label.
Is there anything specific you'd like to do with your custom widget? I'm here to help!

```PYTHON
__init__ abc parameters
```

### ^^^ intended question/thought ^^^ How might I have an ABC class init with paramaters and still inherit a QWidget

When defining the __init__ method for an abstract base class (ABC) in PySide6, you can use it to set up parameters that your subclass widgets will need. Here's an example showing how to include parameters in the __init__ method:

```Python
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QWidget
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MyWidgetBase(ABC, QWidget):
    def __init__(self, title: str, width: int, height: int, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.title = title
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.setup_ui()

    @abstractmethod
    def setup_ui(self):
        pass  # This method will be implemented by subclasses
```

In this example, MyWidgetBase has an __init__ method that takes title, width, and height parameters along with any other arguments (\*args and \*\*kwargs). These parameters are then stored as instance variables.

Here's how you might subclass MyWidgetBase and use these parameters:

```Python
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QLabel, QVBoxLayout

class MyCustomWidget(MyWidgetBase):
    def setup_ui(self):
        self.setWindowTitle(self.title)
        self.setFixedSize(self.width, self.height)

        layout = QVBoxLayout(self)
        label = QLabel("Hello, PySide6!", self)
        layout.addWidget(label)
        self.setLayout(layout)

# Example usage:
widget = MyCustomWidget("My Custom Widget", 400, 300)
widget.show()
```

In this subclass, the setup_ui method sets the window title and size using the parameters provided to the base class. The custom widget can be instantiated with specific values for title, width, and height.

Is this along the lines of what you were thinking? If you need any further tweaks or have specific requirements, feel free to let me know!
